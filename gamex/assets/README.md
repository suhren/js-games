## Tiled

In order to save all properties of the object in each level, you must enable
````
Edit -> Preferences -> Repeat last export on save
Edit -> Preferences -> Enable "Detach Templates
````

Make sure the map has the following properties:

```
name: (string)
description: (string)
```

You can drag and drop template objects from the folder `assets/templates`.

Export the levels or the tileset using `File -> Export As... -> levels/file.json`
